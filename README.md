# In-memory IGC track viewer

This api is an online service that will allow users to browse information about IGC files. 
IGC is an international file format for soaring track files that are used by paragliders and gliders. 
The program will store submitted tracks in memory by saving them into Go lang data structures such as Structs, Slices, Maps etc. 
These files can be browsed later by entering the specific URL paths defined later in this README.

For the development of the IGC processing, I have been using the open source IGC library for Go: goigc
